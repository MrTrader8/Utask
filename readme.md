# File Storage Convention:

All documentation will be stored in the 'docs' directory.

All source code will be stored in the 'code' directory.

Within both the 'docs' and 'code' directories, files will be sorted by phase.

For example, a piece of documentation submitted in phase X should be stored in docs/phaseX/
