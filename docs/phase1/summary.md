# Summary
The concept of information sharing has been growing rapidly along with multiple common search engines such as Google and Yahoo; however, these generic web search platforms may not provide best results for the users who prefer to search within a narrow scope or without going to a third-party website. Our goal is to design and implement a tailored search engine application “UTask” for users from the University of Toronto Scarborough (UTSC) community. The tool will allow users to create and manage their personal accounts, efficiently search files/links with customized filters, and upload/download files to their private online drives to form a powerful information sharing and management platform.

The key users of this application will be the instructors and students at UTSC. Our search application will significantly improve user experience under many scenarios, compared to the current search engines: for example, when instructors from UTSC are trying to upload their documents into a centralized drive and easily share them with students. Users can also refine their search using the advanced search tool to quickly locate relevant files from both personal and/or shared resources in their drive. Additionally, when students need to search useful links, such as the UTSC GPA calculator, or test banks for a particular course that are available online, UTask will provide them the most suitable search results narrowed down for the UTSC community by always prioritizing UTSC related contents and instructors’ uploads by default, combined with other filters that users specify, to ensure best search results efficiency.
