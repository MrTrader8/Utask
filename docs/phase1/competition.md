# Competition

The two main groups of target users include UTSC instructors and students. Therefore, we devised exclusive features for these groups on top of the standard features.

## For All Users
1. Web Search results are narrowed down by default to documents and sites that are directly related to the University of Toronto, reducing the time and complexity of accessing campus resources such as scheduling, research papers, past exams, course information etc. while providing an unparalleled level of accuracy and relevance.
Search engines like Google and Bing have their advantage in terms of breadth and popularity, but our product automatically tailors search results to those that are most relevant and applicable to our users in a way that would otherwise require a lot of manual result filtering of on other platforms.

2. Advanced web search options, including the option of filtering results to only those with a University of Toronto domain, reducing the complexity and effort needed to achieve the same results on another search platform.

## For both students and staff
1. All registered users are given access to UTask drive, on which they can view shared files and store their own files in the cloud. In UTask drive, students and staff can quickly perform lookups on their resources in terms of a given topic, course, or theme as to provide unparalleled relevance that general web searches on other platforms cannot reproduce.

2. Advanced search is offered for both web searches and drive queries. This allows users to filter quickly access course and university resources in terms of their selected keywords and topics.

3. Students and staff are given direct and convenient access to campus services such as Acorn, Quercus, Webmail, and AccessAbility services right from their homepage, making UTask the one-stop solution for all campus-related needs. For example, instead of searching “Acorn UofT” or “UTSC webmail” on Google, these UofT related recourses are just a click away with our search engine application.

4. All registered users are given the option to add widgets to their dashboard, which can be accessed from anywhere in UTask, such as the live timetable, course announcements, and quick access to the drive. Their dashboard can also be individualized, such as change of color theme and change of font size to suit diverse accessibility requirements.

## For instructors
1. Instructors have the option to upload documents to UTask Drive for their own use, or publish documents to students enrolled in their courses by simply dragging and dropping the file into an indexed class folder, simplifying the process over similar cloud-sharing platforms, many of which are costly and are not tailored for educational purposes.

## For students
1. Students are given the option to search for files their own drives as well as drives shared with them by instructors containing relevant content such as notes, assignment handouts, and weekly readings. Since the concept of UTask is mainly for academic uses, the timely sharing and exchanging of course materials will significantly benefit the student population in ways that other cloud-based sharing services have not.

2. Students can view their timetable directly in the drop down menu on any UTask page, along with other campus resources and sites. This truly makes UTask a comprehensive one-stop access platform that saves students significant amounts of time.
