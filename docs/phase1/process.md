# Process

After meeting up in person during the first meeting and introducing ourselves, we mainly communicated through our Facebook group chat. Kara, our scrum master, also created a Facebook group called "UTask Development" for us to post questions and our work in progress so that we are in sync with where we are in terms of the project. We decided to limit response time to within 2 hours so that members can be updated to any changes immediately. [Here is a link to our group picture.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/373295849272246273/453733400960958467/image.jpg)

Decision are usually made though group meetings, mostly online. Group members would input their thoughts and reasons for the matter, and we would then reach an agreement based on our collective thoughts. For example, when we split the tasks for Phase 1, we first came up with the workload of each deliverables and separate them in a way so that each person would spend comparable amounts of time on each task. Then, we voluntarily chose specific task groups based on our interests and what we were more familiar with. Finally, we set an intermediate deadline well before the deliverable deadline for each task and touched base around that intermediate date to discuss each member's progress, successes, challenges, and concerns.

We defined tasks in terms of two key factors:

1. Priority: The order in which user-requested features and functions should be prioritized in development, such as basic indexing and searching functionality.

2. Difficulty: Ranked in terms of complexity in implementation and time consumption.
